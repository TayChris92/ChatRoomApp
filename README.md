# ChatRoomApp
ChatRoom with group chat, multithreading. Includes custom svg paths and animations for chat bubbles.

I decided to redesign this project. I created a modular structure and I am planning on redesigning the code once again in the future.

This is a Chatroom App which supports group chat. It includes multithreading for the server daemons to support multiple clients.
SVG was used for the chat bubbles.

Please make sure you have JavaFX runtimes installed https://openjfx.io/

You can run this with the included runnable jars. Run the server app once and as many client instances as you want. It operates on localhost at the moment.
